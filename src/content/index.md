# About Me

I have been working in digital marketing and website development for more than 25 years. In that time, I have found that many businesses approach their web presence by employing expensive and time consuming tools and methdologies and in the process often end up wasting time and money trying to imitate the behavior of organizations that are fundamentally different from their own. I believe that the modern focus on analytics in marketing is often a form of process addiction which drains both motivation, purpose, and money from a business with little to no return on the investment.

Instead, I advocate a focus on bottom line digital startegy; I want to help you find out where your business appropriately intersects with the digital landscape. For some businesses this can involve analyitics but rather than drown clients in numbers, I seek to find the few that matter and spend most of our time and energy on moving them rather than counting them.

In my career, I have originated global campaigns, worked with stakeholders on high profile web properties, and managed several small teams to success. I also have experience as a storyteller, voice over artist, and video producer. I enjoy working with other people to create new and entertaining things - be they ad campaigns, products, or experiences.

Please review my services below to understand some of the ways I might be helpful to your organization, or just reach out directly via phone or email.
