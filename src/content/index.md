# Need Help Navigating the Stupid Internet?

I help consultants, therapists, and non-profits learn how to spend less and get more out of their web presence.

### Have you wasted thousands of dollars to end up with only a mediocre website, weak marketing tools, and an email address?

Lots of time and money can be spent on big, all-in-one services that try to do everything. I'm here to help you get away from that.

I practice open-source, ethical, effective marketing techniques.
