# Digital Marketing & Web Consulting

I have been working in the digital space for 25 years as a content strategist, developer, and consultant. I have worked in a wide range of roles and industries includingh gaming, education, and software development. My current interests lie primarily in helping non-profit organizations streamline their digital workflows, leveraging as much open source and non-corporate technology as possible.

I have experience with a large number of niche-specific "all in one" tools as well as in individual services ranging from Marketo to WordPress to MailChimp and many others. I excel at matching organizations to stacks which appropriately fit their problems. I am not a advocate of one particular tool or stack.

My approach is tailored to what your organization needs. For some clients, a simple file cleanup is sufficient. For others, a comprehensive organizational overhaul with a new CRM or other services makes more sense. I measure success by the strength of your reputation and the efficiency of our solution. When your reputation thrives through the most direct path forward, we both win.
