# Need Help Navigating the Stupid Internet?

I help individual consultants, therapists, and non-profits learn how to spend less and get more out of their web presence.

### Have you wasted thousands of dollars to get just an email address, a sub-par website, and weak marketing tools and integrations?

Lots of time can be wasted on big, monolithic services that try to own your whole image online. I'm here to help you get away from that.

I believe in open-source, ethical, effective marketing techniques.

**25+ years of web development experience. Focused on helping individuals and non-profits. Complete training included.**
