# Digital Marketing & Web Consulting

I have been working in the digital space for 25 years as a content strategist, developer, and consultant. In the course of that time I have had a wide range of roles and worked in radio, gaming, Saas, and robotics. My current interests lie primarily in helping non-profit organizations streamline their digital workflow and leverage as much open source and non-corporate technology as possible.

I have experience with a large number of niche specific "all in one" tools as well as in individual services ranging from Marketo to WordPress to MailChimp to many others. I am very good at matching organizations to stacks which appropriately fit their problems. I do not have any relationships with any vendors and I am not a proselytizer of one stack. If you look at my Case Studies below you will see that I have not consistently prescribed the same tools for every problem.

The best solution is the one that fits your organization. For some this means a file cleanup and everything else being left alone. For some this means an organizational rework into a new CRM or set of digital services. In other words - I am not trying to generate hours I am trying to help build your reputation as well as my own to make the world slightly better, hopefully.
