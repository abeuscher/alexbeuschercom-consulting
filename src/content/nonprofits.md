# Nonprofit Solutions

<div class="nonprofit-understanding">

## Understanding Your Challenges

Working with nonprofits means understanding the unique constraints you face: limited budgets, volunteer coordination, competing priorities, and the constant pressure to do more with less. After years of consulting with nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, and mission-driven teams, I've learned that the best technology solutions are often the simplest ones that grow with your organization.

Your mission comes first. Technology should support that mission, not complicate it.

## How I Help Nonprofits

<div class="service-item">
### Digital Infrastructure Audit
Get clarity on what you actually have and what you actually need. Many organizations have accumulated tools and systems organically over time, leading to inefficiencies, duplicate costs, and staff frustration. I'll help you map your current digital landscape and identify opportunities for improvement.
</div>

<div class="service-item">
### Website Rescue & Optimization
WordPress sites can become unwieldy over time, especially when managed by volunteers or handed off between agencies. I specialize in cleaning up neglected websites, improving performance, and establishing sustainable workflows that your team can actually maintain.
</div>

<div class="service-item">
### System Integration & Consolidation
Reduce manual work by connecting your existing tools or replacing multiple systems with unified solutions. Whether it's connecting your website to your email system, integrating donation processing, or streamlining volunteer coordination, the goal is always fewer clicks, less duplication, and more time for mission work.
</div>

<div class="service-item">
### Email & Newsletter Optimization
For most nonprofits, email is your most direct connection to supporters. I help organizations improve their email systems - from template design and list management to automation workflows that nurture donor relationships without constant manual effort.
</div>

<div class="service-item">
### Training & Documentation
The best system in the world is worthless if your team can't use it confidently. I provide comprehensive training and create documentation that makes sense to real people. Sometimes an assessment reveals that training is all you need - your systems are fine, you just need to use them better.
</div>

<div class="service-item">
### Agency Relationship Management
Good agencies can be transformative at certain stages of growth. Having worked with agencies for decades, I can help you evaluate proposals, facilitate communication, and ensure you're getting quality work that aligns with your goals and budget.
</div>

</div>

<div class="open-source-focus">

## Open Source Alternatives

Many paid services have open source alternatives that cost more to implement initially but give you complete control over your data and long-term costs. While proprietary solutions often seem easier upfront, open source options can provide better value for organizations planning beyond the next fiscal year.

I help nonprofits evaluate when open source makes sense for their situation and can guide implementation when it does.

<div class="approach-philosophy">

## My Approach

**Listen first.** Every organization has unique needs, existing relationships, and constraints. I spend time understanding your whole situation before recommending anything.

**Improve before replacing.** The best solution is often to optimize what you already have. New systems create new problems, and your team already knows how to use the current tools.

**Plan for handoff.** I'm not trying to create dependency. Every project includes training and documentation so your team can maintain and expand on the work.

**Focus on sustainability.** Quick fixes that break in six months don't help anyone. I prioritize solutions that will serve your organization for years, not just until the next crisis.

</div>

<div class="getting-started">

## Getting Started

**Free consultation** - Let's talk about your current challenges and goals. Many organizations benefit just from having someone with technical experience listen to their situation and offer perspective.

**Assessment process** - If we decide to work together, I start with a comprehensive review of your current systems, workflows, and needs. This assessment often reveals that you're closer to a solution than you think.

**Phased implementation** - Changes happen gradually, with plenty of training and support. Nothing gets switched off until the new system is working reliably.

**Ongoing support** - I maintain relationships with trusted specialists in accounting, design, development, and other technical areas. When your needs extend beyond my expertise, I can help coordinate quality work without the overhead of finding and vetting contractors yourself.
