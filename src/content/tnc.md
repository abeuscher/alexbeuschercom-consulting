# Terms & Conditions

All estimates provided for services represent the best approximation of the hours required to complete the agreed-upon work. However, the nature of digital projects can sometimes lead to adjustments in the scope or timeline.

1. **Estimates & Budget**:  
   Each estimate is an approximation based on the initial project scope. If additional hours are required to complete the project, the client will be notified when 25% of the budgeted hours remain. At that point, the client may choose from one of the following options:
   - **Approve Additional Hours**: The client can agree to extend the project and cover any additional hours at the agreed hourly rate.
   - **Adjust Project Scope**: Alternatively, we can discuss modifying the project scope to ensure the remaining work can be completed within the original budget.
2. **Open Communication**:  
   I commit to maintaining transparent communication throughout the project. If at any point it becomes clear that the scope or timeline needs to be adjusted, I will initiate a discussion with the client to explore solutions.
3. **Invoicing**:  
   Invoices will be provided based on the hours worked and will reflect the terms outlined in this agreement. Payment is expected within \[X\] days of receiving the invoice.
