The site was struggling with basic performance metrics and the marketing team was drowning in analytics data without clear direction on what mattered.</p><p>I rebuilt the theme using modern practices, eliminated unnecessary front-end plugins, and implemented version control. More importantly, I worked with stakeholders to identify three key performance indicators that actually mattered to the business. By focusing our optimization efforts on these core metrics rather than trying to improve everything at once, we were able to demonstrate clear ROI and sustainable growth.</p><p>The result was not just technical improvement but a fundamental shift in how the organization approached web analytics. The marketing team was able to make data-driven decisions without getting lost in vanity metrics, leading to more effective campaigns and better resource allocation.</p>"
